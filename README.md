# Meal Tinder
All the code behind Meal Tinder: an ICS4U term project by Alanna &amp; Cheryl.

For our ICS4U term project, we created a program that generates meal recommendations from our local canteen based on user preferences.
After generating said meals, the user can favourite or delete specific meals with the easily accessible heart and trash can buttons.
All information is saved to each user's personal account after they sign up, which they can access again after logging in.

The backend was coded using Flask, a micro-web framework written in Python. The frontend (UI design) was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
